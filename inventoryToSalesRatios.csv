2,"Beginning with reference year 2009, the data are classified by industry based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2012."
3,"With the release on May 16, 2019, the Monthly Survey of Manufacturing (MSM) has published revised estimates. Estimates of sales of goods manufactured, inventories and orders have been revised back to January 2013 for the unadjusted data, and back to January 2011 for the seasonally adjusted data."
